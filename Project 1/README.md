# Assignment 1

Building a scalar and tensor network for classifying basic MNIST data.

- data.py, contains a basic function to load synthetic training data and MNIST dataset, by Peter Bloem (2020)
- scalarBackpropagation.py, contains an implementation of a simple scalar neural network, using only basic python and the math library, used to train a network on simple synthetic data
- tensorBackpropagation.py, contains an implementation of a neural network with 300 hidden units and 10 output units using numpy, aimed at classifying MNIST data
