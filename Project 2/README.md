# Assignment 2

Build some more advanced network and experiment with PyTorch library.

- vugrad, this folder contains code a mini autodiff library by Peter Bloem (2021) for the course Deep Learning at VU Amsterdam
- basicNetwork.py, contains the code for creating a basic computational graph with two tensors and a sum operation
- adaptedMLP.py, contains an adaptation of train_mlp.py by Peter Bloem (2021) to compare performance of a ReLU vs. sigmoid activation for hidden layer
- torchNetwork.py, contains an implementation of a PyTorch network trained on MNIST dataset, built following the 60-minute blitz tutorial.

Code written by Enrico Calleris, unless otherwise specified.
